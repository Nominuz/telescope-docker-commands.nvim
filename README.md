This command will display a list of available Docker commands. Simply select the command you wish to execute, and it will run in your terminal.

## Configuration

You can customize the behavior of the Telescope Docker Commands extension by modifying your Neovim configuration file. Hereâ€™s an example of how to set it up:

```lua
require('telescope').setup {
  defaults = {
    -- Default configuration for Telescope
  },
  extensions = {
    docker_commands = {
      -- Customize your Docker commands here
    }
  }
}

require('telescope').load_extension('docker_commands')
```

Adjust the settings as needed to suit your preferences.
